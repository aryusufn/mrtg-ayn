systemd and init.d config files for MRTG
----------------------------------------

Hello everyone,

These are the systemd and init scripts that I will provide for Debian as of
October 2021. Debian usually provides these two files to help to start and
stop services.

These config files are using some new features released in MRTG 2.17.9, as
the option --fhs updated from FHS 2.3 to 3.0, the new location for default
mrtg.cfg (/etc/mrtg/mrtg.cfg) and the dynamic creation for main directories,
as /run/mrtg/.

The init script (/etc/init.d/mrtg) was originally written by
Stefan SF <stefan@sf-net.com> for Fedora Project and updated by me to be used
in Debian. The original init is being provided in contrib/mrtg-start-script/
